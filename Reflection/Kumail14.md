# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists.

Answer: A more interesting use for this basic layout can be finding out the participants preferences in humanities. This means that, historians and humanists can identify the participants favourite hisotrical figures, events, and time periods. This information can be valuable for historians and humanists becasue they can see how much knowledge is present amongst the participants. Also, they may feel that they can further the knowledge of the participants by teaching them about the topics in demand. Lastly, historians and humanists can gather the information provided and see which topics are overly used or studied and may decide to present new topics in order to increase the knowledge of participants.

## Question 2
### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

Answer: Some of the responsibilities that the researcher has towards the participants may include ensuring their privacy because the participants may not want their information which they have provided to be disclosed to the public. Furthermore, it is the reseachers responsibility to breif or explain to the participants how their information will be used or managed, which means that the participants get a general idea of the significance of their contribution towards the project. Also, it is the researchers responsibility to frame or present all questions in a proper and organized manner so that the participants can conveniently provide their information. Lastly, it is the responsibility or the researcher to erase or get rid of the information which has been provided by the participants once the research is over. 

## Question 3
### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

Answer: The fields that need to be provided for each record are favourite historical figure, favourite historical event, and favourite historical time period. Some of the limitations of this data structure can be that participants may have more than one entry for each of the fields menitoned earlier. Also, particpants may not be able to specify why certain historical figures, events, and time periods may be of interest to them. This can be a limitation becasue the researcher may not be able to come to a detailed conclusion with the information which has been provided.
